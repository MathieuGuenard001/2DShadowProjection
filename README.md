# 2DShadowProjection

See https://www.redblobgames.com/articles/visibility/ for the basic idea behind this project. Also, see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line%E2%80%93line_intersection for the maths behind the "ray casting". This code is in
no way optimised, or the best algorithm for casting shadows in 2D. The purpose of this project was to learn the basics of
Javascript.
